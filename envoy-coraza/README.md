# envoy-coraza

Envoy Proxy-Wasm HTTP filter backed by the `coraza` engine. The filter compiles
policy generations and enforces them on request and response phases; the
standalone Envoy harness in [`examples/envoy-coraza`](../examples/envoy-coraza)
exercises the lifecycle checks.

## Embedding the OWASP Core Rule Set

`make build-envoy-wasm-crs` downloads the CRS release pinned in the tracked
`envoy-coraza/crs.pin`, verifies its SHA-256, and builds `envoy_coraza.wasm`
with the tree embedded behind the non-default `embed-crs` feature. The fetched
tree stays in the gitignored `envoy-coraza/crs/` (`make crs-clean` removes it);
`make test-envoy-wasm-crs` fetches it and runs the embedded-CRS tests, and
`make run-envoy-crs` brings up the example Envoy with the CRS loaded and leaves
it running for manual requests. A build
with the feature on fails when the tree is missing, stale, or partial, so plain
`make build-envoy-wasm` is unchanged.

### Embedding a custom CRS tree

The build verifies the tree against the pin by release, tarball digest, and file
count — not per-file contents — so a locally modified tree embeds too:

```sh
make crs-fetch                                  # start from the pinned release
# ...edit or delete files under envoy-coraza/crs/rules/...
make crs-restamp                                # rewrites the marker's file count
cargo build --locked --release --target wasm32-wasip1 -p envoy-coraza \
    --features envoy-coraza/embed-crs
```

The marker keeps the pinned release and digest, so the artifact still reports
which release the custom tree is based on. `make crs-restamp` is only needed
when the edits add or remove files: `crs-fetch` replaces the tree when the
marker or the file count no longer matches, so content-only edits that keep
the count survive it — including the `crs-fetch` prerequisite of
`make build-envoy-wasm-crs`, which then embeds the edited tree. `make
crs-clean` is the way back to the pinned tree. The restamp keeps the release
provenance but not a record of the local edits; treat a custom artifact as
unreviewed content.

The embedded files live in their own `crs/` namespace, so a policy that already
includes `rules/*.conf` cannot pick up the CRS by accident. A wildcard-first
pattern such as `Include **/*.conf` intentionally does match the embedded `crs/`
namespace. The policy includes the CRS files by name:

```json
{
  "directives_map": {
    "crs": [
      "SecRuleEngine On",
      "SecRequestBodyAccess On",
      "SecRequestBodyLimit 13107200",
      "Include crs/crs-setup.conf",
      "Include crs/rules/*.conf"
    ]
  },
  "default_directives": "crs"
}
```

A configured `rule_data` entry whose normalized name matches an embedded file
overrides that file. Without the `embed-crs` feature the same directives work,
but the deployment must supply `crs/crs-setup.conf` (the release's
`crs-setup.conf.example`, which the feature-on build maps automatically) and
the complete `crs/rules/*.conf` **and** `crs/rules/*.data` set through the
`rule_data` config key; a partial set either fails to compile (missing `.data`
files) or cannot block (missing the blocking evaluation rules).

The fetched tree carries the upstream CRS Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`, and a
feature-on build embeds it with the rules as `crs/LICENSE`.

The embedded tree uses about 50 of the 1024 `rule_data` file slots and about
0.9 MiB of the 8 MiB total budget in a feature-on build. The configured
generation logs the embedded CRS version once at configure time.
